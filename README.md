## Running the game efficiently 
* It is Linux, in the project folder, open the terminal and use the command below
> `php -S 127.0.0.1:4040`
* This makes the game run listening on the port 4040, after this you need to go to your web browser and type the following
> `127.0.0.1:4040`
* This will begin the game automatically, some IDE's give problems and discard other features when running the game, this way no feature is cut out and the game runs smoothly.
